# node-posix

The missing POSIX system calls for Node.

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/melor/node-posix.png)](http://travis-ci.org/melor/node-posix)

## FAQ

* Q: Why?
* A: Because the Node core has a limited set of POSIX system calls.
* Q: How mature/stable is this?
* A: Each version released in NPM has decent automated test coverage. The
  module is still new and not battle-hardened.
* Q: I have a feature request/bug report...
* A: Please submit a pull request or an issue ticket at
  https://github.com/melor/node-posix

## Compatibility and API Stability

* Some degree of POSIX compliance is sought after, but this module is not always
  restricted by the standard.
  For example `posix.openlog()` also supports non-POSIX facility codes.
* node-posix version format: *MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH*
* *PATCH* version upgrades will not break backward compatibility, so it should be
  safe to upgrade from 1.0.0 to 1.0.1, 1.0.2, etc.
* *MAJOR* and *MINOR* version upgrades *probably* break backward-compatibility in
  some way, which may or may not affect your module.
* Recommended way to define a version dependency to node-posix in your
  `package.json`: `"dependencies": { "posix": "1.0.x" }`
* Update the version in `package.json` manually after validating compatibility
  with new node-posix *MAJOR* and *MINOR* releases).

## General Information

### User and Group ID Management
* `posix.getgid()` is an alias to Node core `process.getgid()`
* `posix.getuid()` is an alias to Node core `process.getuid()`
* `posix.setgid()` is an alias to Node core `process.setgid()`
* `posix.setuid()` is an alias to Node core `process.setuid()`,
  NOTE: should be used carefully  due to inconsistent behavior under different
  operating systems, see http://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/~hchen/paper/usenix02.html

### Resource limits
* `ulimit()` is obsolete, use `posix.setrlimit()` instead.

## General usage

* Installation: `npm install posix`
* In your code: `var posix = require('posix');`

## POSIX System Calls

### posix.chroot(path)

Changes the root directory of the calling process to that specified in `path`.
This directory will be used for pathnames beginning with `/`. The root
directory is inherited by all children of the calling process.

The working directory is also automatically set to the new root directory.

NOTE: Please be aware of the limitations of `chroot` jails:

* "Best Practices for UNIX `chroot()` Operations":
  http://www.unixwiz.net/techtips/chroot-practices.html
* "How to break out of a `chroot()` jail":
  http://www.bpfh.net/simes/computing/chroot-break.html

Example:

    posix.chroot('/somewhere/safe');

### posix.getegid()

Returns the current process's effective group ID.

    console.log('Effective GID: ' + posix.getegid());

### posix.geteuid()

Returns the current process's effective user ID.

    console.log('Effective UID: ' + posix.geteuid());

### posix.getgrnam(group)

Get the group database entry for the given group. `group` can be specified
either as a numeric GID or a group name (string).

    var util = require('util');
    util.inspect(posix.getgrnam('wheel'));

Example output of above:

    { name: 'wheel', passwd: '*', gid: 0, members: [ 'root' ] }

### posix.getpgid(pid)

Return the process group ID of the current process (`posix.getpgid(0)`) or of
a process of a given PID (`posix.getpgid(PID)`).

    console.log('My PGID: ' + posix.getpgid(0));
    console.log('init's PGID: ' + posix.getpgid(1));

### posix.getppid()

Returns the parent process's PID.

    console.log('Parent PID: ' + posix.getppid());

### posix.getpwnam(user)

Get the user database entry for the given user. `user` can be specified either
as a numeric UID or a username (string).

    var util = require('util');
    util.inspect(posix.getpwnam('root'));

Example output of above:

    { name: 'root',
      passwd: '*',
      uid: 0,
      gid: 0,
      gecos: 'System Administrator',
      shell: '/bin/sh',
      dir: '/var/root' }

### posix.getrlimit(resource)

Get resource limits. (See getrlimit(2).)

The `soft` limit is the value that the kernel enforces for the
corresponding resource. The `hard` limit acts as a ceiling for the soft
limit: an unprivileged process may only set its soft limit to a value in the
range from 0 up to the hard limit, and (irreversibly) lower its hard limit.

A limit value of `null` indicates "unlimited" (RLIM_INFINITY).

Supported resources:

`'core'` (RLIMIT_CORE) Maximum size of core file.  When 0 no core dump files
are created.

`'cpu'` (RLIMIT_CPU) CPU time limit in seconds.  When the process reaches the
soft limit, it is sent a SIGXCPU signal. The default action for this signal is
to terminate the process.

`'data'` (RLIMIT_DATA) The maximum size of the process's data segment
(initialized data, uninitialized data, and heap).

`'fsize'` (RLIMIT_FSIZE) The maximum size of files that the process may create.
Attempts to extend a file beyond this limit result in delivery of a SIGXFSZ
signal.

`'nofile'` (RLIMIT_NOFILE) Specifies a value one greater than the maximum file
descriptor number that can be opened by this process.

`'stack'` (RLIMIT_STACK) The maximum size of the process stack, in bytes. Upon
reaching this limit, a SIGSEGV signal is generated.

`'as'` (RLIMIT_AS) The maximum size of the process's virtual memory (address
space) in bytes.

    var limits = posix.getrlimit('nofile');
    console.log('Current limits: soft=' + limits.soft + ', max=' + limits.hard);

### posix.initgroups(user, group)

Sets the group access list to all groups of which user is a member.
The additional group group is also added to the list.

    posix.initgroups("node", "httpd");  // all groups of 'node' plus 'httpd'

### posix.setegid(gid)

Sets the Effective group ID of the current process. `gid` can be either a
numeric GID or a group name (string).

    posix.setegid(0); // set effective group UID to "wheel"
    posix.setegid('nobody');

### posix.seteuid(uid)

Sets the Effective user ID of the current process. `uid` can be either a
numeric UID or a username (string).

    posix.seteuid(0); // set effective UID to "root"
    posix.seteuid('nobody');

### posix.setregid(rgid, egid)

Sets the Real and Effective group IDs of the current process. `rgid` and `egid`
can be either a numeric UIDs or group names (strings). A value of `-1` means
that the corresponding GID is left unchanged.

    posix.setregid(-1, 1000); // just set the EGID to 1000
    posix.setregid('www-data', 'www-data'); // change both RGID and EGID to "www-data"

### posix.setreuid(ruid, euid)

Sets the Real and Effective user IDs of the current process. `ruid` and `euid`
can be either a numeric UIDs or usernames (strings). A value of `-1` means
that the corresponding UID is left unchanged.

IMPORTANT NOTE: what happens to the Saved UID when `setreuid()` is called is
operating system dependent. For example on OSX the Saved UID seems to be set
to the previous EUID. This means that the process can escape back to EUID=0
simply by calling `setreuid(0, 0)`. A workaround for this is to call
`posix.setreuid(ruid, euid)` twice with the same arguments.

    posix.setreuid(-1, 1000); // just set the EUID to 1000
    posix.setreuid('nobody', 'nobody'); // change both RUID and EUID to "nobody"

### posix.setrlimit(resource, limits)

Set resource limits. (See setrlimit(2).) Supported resource types are listed
under `posix.getrlimit`.

The `limits` argument is an object in the form
`{ soft: SOFT_LIMIT, hard: HARD_LIMIT }`. Current limit values are used if
either `soft` or `hard` key is not specifing in the `limits` object. A limit
value of `null` indicates "unlimited" (RLIM_INFINITY).

    // raise maximum number of open file descriptors to 10k, hard limit is left unchanged
    posix.setrlimit('nofile', { soft: 10000 });

    // enable core dumps of unlimited size
    posix.setrlimit('core', { soft: null, hard: null });

### posix.setsid()

Creates a session and sets the process group ID. Returns the process group ID.

    console.log('Session ID: ' + posix.setsid());

## Syslog

### posix.openlog(identity, options, facility)

Open a connection to the logger.

Arguments:

* `identity` - defines the name of the process visible in the logged entries.
* `options` -  set of option flags (see below).
* `facility` - facility code for the logged messages (see below).

Options:

* `'cons'` - Log to the system console on error.
* `'ndelay'` - Connect to syslog daemon immediately.
* `'nowait'` - Do not wait for child processes.
* `'odelay'` - Delay open until syslog() is called.
* `'pid'` - Log the process ID with each message.

Facilities:

NOTE: only `'user'` and `'local0'` .. `'local7'` are defined in the POSIX
standard. However, the other codes should be pretty well supported on most
platforms.

* `'kern'`
* `'user'`
* `'mail'`
* `'news'`
* `'uucp'`
* `'daemon'`
* `'auth'`
* `'cron'`
* `'lpr'`
* `'local0'` .. `'local7'`

Example:

    posix.openlog('myprog', {odelay: true, pid: true}, 'local7');

### posix.closelog()

Close connection to the logger.

### posix.setlogmask(mask)

Sets a priority mask for log messages. Further `posix.syslog()` messages are
only sent out if their priority is included in the mask. Priorities are listed
under `posix.syslog()`.

    // only send the most critical messages
    posix.setlogmask({emerg:true, alert: true, crit: true});

### posix.syslog(priority, message)

Send a message to the syslog logger using the given `priority`.

Priorities:

* `'emerg'`
* `'alert'`
* `'crit'`
* `'err'`
* `'warning'`
* `'notice'`
* `'info'`
* `'debug'`

Example:

    posix.syslog('info', 'hello, world!');

## hostname

### posix.gethostname()

Returns the hostname of the operating system.

### posix.sethostname(hostname)

Sets the hostname of the operating system.

Example:

    posix.sethostname('beefheart');
